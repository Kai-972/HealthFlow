## AI-Powered Automated Test Case Generation for Healthcare Compliance
This solution streamlines the creation of compliance-ready test cases from healthcare requirements using AI. Here’s the step-by-step technical workflow:

---

### 1. Input Layer: Requirement Ingestion
- **Start** by uploading a requirements document (PDF/DOCX) or pasting requirement text.
- **Select** the relevant compliance framework (e.g., HIPAA, ISO 13485, FDA).
- **Choose** the desired export format (Jira, CSV, XML, Word).
- **Submit** the requirements for processing.
---

### 2. AI Processing Layer: Automated Analysis & Mapping
- **NLP Parsing:** The backend extracts and parses requirements using LLMs (e.g., Gemini API).
- **Requirement Extraction:** Key requirements are identified from the input.
- **Regulatory Reference Detection:** The system detects references to regulatory clauses.
- **Mapping Engine:** 
    - Links requirements to specific regulations.
    - Maps regulations to potential test cases.

- **Test Case Generation:** 
    - Generates structured test cases (including edge cases) mapped to compliance clauses.

- **Traceability Matrix:** 
    - Builds a matrix linking requirements ↔ test cases ↔ compliance.

- **Explainability Panel:** 
    - Displays AI reasoning for each mapping and test case.

---

### 3. Output Layer: Review, Export & Interaction
- **Dashboard View:** 
    - Displays generated test cases, traceability matrix, and compliance badges.

- **Export Options:** 
    - Download test cases as CSV, XML, Word, or push to Jira (mock/demo).

- **Chatbot Q&A:** 
    - Users can query requirements or test cases and see linked compliance mappings.

- **End Review:** 
    - Option to start a new requirement cycle or ask further questions.

---

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Automation:** From requirement upload to compliance-mapped test case export.
- **Traceability:** Visual matrix for audit and QA transparency.
- **Explainability:** AI reasoning for trust and regulatory acceptance.
- **Integration Ready:** Export to Jira and standard formats for real-world workflows.
