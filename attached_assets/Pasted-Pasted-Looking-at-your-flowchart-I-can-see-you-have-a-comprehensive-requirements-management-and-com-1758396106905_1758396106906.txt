Looking at your flowchart, I can see you have a comprehensive requirements management and compliance system with three main layers: Input Layer, AI Processing Layer, and Output Layer. To create a model prototype, here are several approaches you can take:

Quick Prototyping Options
1. Low-Code/No-Code Platforms

Use tools like Microsoft Power Platform, Zapier, or Bubble.io to quickly connect the workflow steps
Create simple forms for input and basic automation for processing
Good for validating the user experience flow
2. Mockup/Wireframe Tools

Create interactive prototypes using Figma, Adobe XD, or InVision
Mock up each screen/step in your workflow
Add clickable elements to simulate the user journey
Technical Development Approaches
3. Web-Based Prototype

Build a simple web application using frameworks like React, Vue, or even plain HTML/JS
Start with the core workflow: Upload → Process → Export
Use placeholder functions for AI components initially
4. Python/Jupyter Notebook

Create a step-by-step prototype using Python
Use libraries like Streamlit or Gradio for quick UI creation
Implement basic NLP processing with libraries like spaCy or NLTK
Recommended Starting Steps
Define Your MVP: Focus on 2-3 core features from your flowchart
Start with the Input Layer: Create a simple upload and parsing mechanism
Mock the AI Processing: Use rule-based logic before implementing actual AI
Build Basic Output: Start with simple text/CSV export functionality
Would you like me to help you create a specific type of prototype? For example, I could build you a web-based interactive prototype or help you plan the technical architecture for development.

Recommended Starting Steps
1. Define Your MVP: Focus on 2-3 core features from your flowchart
2. Start with the Input Layer: Create a simple upload and parsing mechanism
3. Mock the AI Processing: Use rule-based logic before implementing actual AI
4. Build Basic Output: Start with simple text/CSV export functionality
can. you explain properly where i do it and how to do it tell me step by step

I'll walk you through each step with detailed instructions on where and how to implement your MVP prototype.

Step 1: Define Your MVP (2-3 Core Features)
Where to do this: Use a planning document or tool

What to focus on from your flowchart:

Document Upload (Input Layer)
Basic Requirements Extraction (AI Processing Layer - simplified)
Export Results (Output Layer)
How to define it:

Create a simple document listing exactly what your prototype will do
Example: "Upload a requirements document → Extract key requirements using basic text processing → Export results as CSV"
Step 2: Start with Input Layer - Upload & Parsing
Where to do this: I recommend starting with a web-based prototype

Tools needed:

A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, or even online editors like CodePen)
Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge
Step-by-step implementation:

2.1 Create the basic HTML structure
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Requirements Extractor MVP</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Requirements Document Processor</h1>
    <input type="file" id="fileInput" accept=".txt,.doc,.docx,.pdf">
    <button onclick="processFile()">Upload & Process</button>
    <div id="results"></div>
</body>
</html>
2.2 Add file reading functionality
javascript
function processFile() {
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    const file = fileInput.files[0];
    
    if (file) {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(e) {
            const content = e.target.result;
            extractRequirements(content);
        };
        reader.readAsText(file);
    }
}
Step 3: Mock AI Processing with Rule-Based Logic
Where to implement: Add JavaScript functions to your HTML file

How to create simple extraction logic:

3.1 Basic requirements extraction
javascript
function extractRequirements(text) {
    // Simple rule-based extraction
    const requirements = [];
    
    // Look for sentences with requirement keywords
    const sentences = text.split(/[.!?]+/);
    const keywords = ['must', 'shall', 'should', 'required', 'needs to', 'has to'];
    
    sentences.forEach((sentence, index) => {
        const lowerSentence = sentence.toLowerCase();
        if (keywords.some(keyword => lowerSentence.includes(keyword))) {
            requirements.push({
                id: `REQ-${index + 1}`,
                text: sentence.trim(),
                type: 'Functional', // Default type
                priority: 'Medium' // Default priority
            });
        }
    });
    
    displayResults(requirements);
}
3.2 Display extracted requirements
javascript
function displayResults(requirements) {
    const resultsDiv = document.getElementById('results');
    let html = '<h2>Extracted Requirements:</h2><ul>';
    
    requirements.forEach(req => {
        html += `<li><strong>${req.id}:</strong> ${req.text} <em>(${req.type}, ${req.priority})</em></li>`;
    });
    
    html += '</ul>';
    resultsDiv.innerHTML = html;
    
    // Store for export
    window.extractedRequirements = requirements;
}
Step 4: Build Basic Output - CSV Export
Where to add: Continue in the same HTML file

How to implement export functionality:

4.1 Add export button to HTML
html
<button onclick="exportCSV()" style="margin-top: 20px;">Export as CSV</button>
4.2 Create CSV export function
javascript
function exportCSV() {
    if (!window.extractedRequirements) {
        alert('No requirements to export. Please process a document first.');
        return;
    }
    
    // Create CSV content
    let csv = 'ID,Requirement,Type,Priority\n';
    window.extractedRequirements.forEach(req => {
        csv += `"${req.id}","${req.text}","${req.type}","${req.priority}"\n`;
    });
    
    // Download CSV
    const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: 'text/csv' });
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    const a = document.createElement('a');
    a.href = url;
    a.download = 'requirements.csv';
    a.click();
}
Complete MVP Implementation Guide
Where to run your prototype:

Local Development:
Save all code in a single HTML file (e.g., requirements_prototype.html)
Double-click the file to open in your browser
Test with simple text files containing requirements
Online Development:
Use CodePen.io, JSFiddle, or similar online editors
Copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into respective sections
Testing your prototype:

Create a test document with text like:
   The system must authenticate users within 3 seconds.
   The application should display error messages clearly.
   Users need to be able to export data in multiple formats.
Upload the file and verify it extracts requirements
Test the CSV export functionality
Next steps after MVP:

Add more sophisticated text processing
Implement actual NLP libraries
Add requirement categorization
Create a proper backend API
Add database storage
Would you like me to create a complete working prototype as an artifact that you can immediately test and use?
